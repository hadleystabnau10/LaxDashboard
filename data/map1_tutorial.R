# this script is drawn partly from https://r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf.html


# - what ggspatial can do, and using it to add annotations like scale bar and north arrow
# - using geom_text and annotate to add country names
# - more theme options: grid lines, background color

# Good practice: load your packages at the beginning of the script, 
# and/or use a comment at the top of the script to tell users what packages  
# they need to have installed on their computer

# packages you'll need to install if you haven't already:
# rnaturalearth, rnaturalearthdata, rnaturalearthhires, mapview, ggplot2, sf, ggspatial
# note that some of these you don't need to load (using library), just make sure they're installed

# you can use install.packages() for all the packages except rnaturalearthhires, 
# which uses another package called pak to install it (this is common)
# install.packages("pak")
# pak::pkg_install("ropensci/rnaturalearthhires")

#install.packages("rnaturalearth")
#install.packages("rnaturalearthdata")
#install.packages("mapview")
#install.packages("sf")
#install.packages("ggspatial")

# first, let's explore the data -----------------------------------------------

# rnaturalearth is an R package to access and work with a public domain map dataset called Natural Earth
# more about rnaturalearth: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnaturalearth/vignettes/rnaturalearth.html

library(rnaturalearth)

# what package is the ne_countries function from?
plot(ne_countries(type = "countries", scale = "small"))
plot(ne_countries(country = "united kingdom", type = "countries"))
plot(ne_countries(country = "united kingdom", type = "map_units")) # requires having the rnaturalearthdata package
plot(ne_countries(country = "united kingdom", scale = "large")) # requires having the rnaturalearthhires package

# nicer plots with mapview
# recall: what's the difference between mapview() and mapview::mapview()?
mapview::mapview(ne_countries(country = "united kingdom", scale = "large")$geometry)
mapview::mapview(ne_countries(country = "ireland", scale = "small")$geometry)
mapview::mapview(ne_countries(country = "ireland", scale = "medium")$geometry)
mapview::mapview(ne_countries(country = "ireland", scale = "large")$geometry)

# you can also look at the coastlines
plot(ne_coastline())



# now, let's start making some maps -------------------------------------------

library(ggplot2)

library(ggspatial) # more about ggspatial: https://paleolimbot.github.io/ggspatial/articles/ggspatial.html

# what are three ways you can figure out what expand = FALSE does?
# - set it false, true
# - look it up on R ?coord_sf
# - Google it "What does the expand = FALSE argument do in coord_sf()?"

# now we start to use ggspatial for the annotation_scale and annotation_north_arrow functions
# - adds a scale and a north arrow to the plot
